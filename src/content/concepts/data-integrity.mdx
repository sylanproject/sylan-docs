# Data Integrity

Nodes post an **EIP-712 Snapshot** referencing a `contentHash` of the providerâ€™s response.
- `contentHash`: keccak256 hash of the serialized response (or pointer).
- `seqNo`: optional sequence monotonicity.
- `providerTs` / `ttl`: freshness constraints.

This ensures off-chain payloads are **authentic and consistent** without storing large blobs on-chain.
