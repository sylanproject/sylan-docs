# Sylan Docs

This repository contains the **official documentation** for the [Sylan Protocol](https://sylan.xyz), a decentralized API marketplace powered by the **SYL token**.

## Overview

Sylan enables:
- **API Providers** to publish APIs and set monetization plans (Subscription or PayPerCall).
- **Consumers** to purchase access using SYL tokens via on-chain escrow.
- **Nodes** to fetch provider-signed data, reach consensus, and return results securely.

All payments are in SYL and fees are split among **Providers, Nodes, and the Platform**.
